*__I am a graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology, where I have explored the vast world of technology and its applications. My primary interests lie in web development, Android development(MERN stack).I believe that every new project demands a different skill set, and you must adapt to keep pace with the evolving IT industry. My constant hunger for learning and exploring new technologies drives me to continually push the boundaries of my work, acquiring new knowledge and skills along the way. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and embark on exciting projects together. Let's create something amazing!
